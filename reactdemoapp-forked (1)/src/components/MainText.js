      <p>I've done a quick demo for you.</p>
      <p>
        I'm purposely throwing you in at the deep end here, so don't worry if
        this all looks a bit daunting, I'll be able to explain a bit more in
        person. This should give you an idea of how we work, and what I spend a
        good amount of time doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll go through this with you in person, but feel free to have a play
        about with this after and ask questions.

        Your best friend for starting out will be this -
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">W3Schools</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you're stuck this will be able to teach about HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript, all of which we as developers use regularly.
